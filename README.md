But maybe the priority should be "low" if the scene is clear. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the priority is "high" because it's a rescue mission, even if no survivors are found. But the situation says no survivors detected, so maybe the mission is to confirm that. So the priority could be "medium" or "low". I think "medium" is safer. Alternatively, maybe the priority is "high" because it's a rescue mission, but since no survivors are found, it's adjusted. I need to make a decision here. Let's go with "medium" for priority.
